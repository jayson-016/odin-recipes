    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The cabbage roll casserole has all the ingredients of stuffed cabbage rolls but is a lot easier to make! This
        basic recipe will appeal to everyone but if you prefer more flavor, consider adding crushed garlic, paprika,
        thyme, or cayenne pepper.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>

        <li>3 ½ pounds chopped cabbage</li>

        <li>1 (29 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>

        <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>

        <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>2 (14 ounce) cans beef broth</li>

    </ul>

        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and
